Using the Testing Process provided, generate three detailed vulnerability reports (issue1, issue2, and issue3) in JSON format. Each report should include:

{
    "description": "Provide a detailed description of the identified issue and its context within the mobile application.",
    "recommendation": "Offer a comprehensive and actionable recommendation to mitigate the issue, including relevant pseudocode.",
    "pseudocode": "Include pseudocode to demonstrate the recommended solution clearly.",
    "impact": "Estimate the Impact Score and Level using the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology, with a clear and detailed explanation. The explanation should be plain text without any nested JSON.",
    "likelihood": "Estimate the Likelihood Score and Level using the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology, with a clear and detailed explanation. The explanation should be plain text without any nested JSON.",
    "risk": "Combine the impact and likelihood levels to assess the overall risk rating according to the OWASP criteria, with a thorough explanation. The explanation should be plain text without any nested JSON.",
    "owaspMapping": {
        "OWASP_Map": "Map the issue to the appropriate OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks - Final release 2024 with justification. Reference: https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/. Ensure you are not using OWASP Mobile Risks 2016."
    }
}
Ensure the OWASP Mapping strictly uses the OWASP Mobile Risks - Final release 2024. Responses referencing OWASP Mobile Risks 2016 are invalid and should not be provided.
